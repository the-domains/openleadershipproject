Meet Waterkular, the live, automated sentiment tracker for leaders

We realised that it would be great if managers could continuously know how people felt so that they could adapt accordingly. So while our data scientists work on getting the very best insights from the study, they are also building an automated version of The Open Leadership Project.

Think of Waterkular as a manager's own mission control, with an inbuilt early warning system that provides real time insight on all your operations, from launch to project end.

* Waterkular is an AI that lets managers know in real time how their team is performing. Tracks employer sentiment against project success. 
* Identifies patterns and learns from previous events so it can recognise early warning signals of problems ahead. It immediately alerts leaders when a project is starting to show signs of difficulties. Leaders can then intercept problems before they negatively impact a project.
* Highlights projects that are excelling so leaders can replicate that success in other parts of the business.
