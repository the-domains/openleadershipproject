  A meagre one in five of us worldwide rate our team leaders very highly*. So
  isn’t it about time we told our line managers, department heads and CEOs
  around the planet what we want from our leaders? The trouble is, if we
  personally set a meeting with the person responsible for promotions (or
  redundancies) it might get a little awkward, especially if they have a
  terrible management style. This is why the #OpenLeadershipProject was created.
  It’s your chance to be part of a global movement that is anonymously
  uncovering what makes a great leader by surfacing the traits and skills that
  inspire and motivate a workforce - without any of the toe-gazing and blushing
  of a one-on-one with the boss or an out-dated 360 review.
