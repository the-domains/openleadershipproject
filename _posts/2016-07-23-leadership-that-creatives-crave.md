# Leadership that Creatives Crave

## Over 1000 stories, across 12 markets it has revealed that creatives want decisiveness in collaboration, empathy but most importantly a leader's expertise.

The uncomfortable truth is that only 1 in 5 people in the Creative Classes rate their bosses very highly. 80% of people in the Creative industries want leaders to understand the emotional impact of their behaviour. Yet only 25% of people believe their boss has this understanding when the going gets tough. Unfortunately, the other 55% are probably thinking \#WTF? As a leader, when was the last time you stopped to think of the emotional impact you're having?

The image shows the data. At first it looks like a mess of stories, emotions, and rants and ratings, but when you begin to apply algorithms, sense is brought to the data.

What you see here are clusters of people with the same desires. Here you have the 'Independents' in pink across the top, 'Leader Loyalists' in the left corner in a orangy-yellow and the 'Wondering Souls' smack bang in the middle.

Leader loyalists have totally bought into the agencies' leadership. They have a deep relationship with their boss, who they rate very highly. Their boss knows them well -- and posses an excellent understanding of the emotional impact they have. In turn, their boss has a direct and positive influence on Leader Loyalists' productivity, loyalty and most importantly happiness. You need an agency full of these folks.

The Wondering Souls are at the other end of the spectrum. They'd definitely meet the recruiter who comes poaching for the start up, agency or company down the road. They believe their leader's performance is so-so and therefore only has somewhat of an effect on their productivity and loyalty.

Although we think that we are different. The leaderships behaviours that motivate each of us are quite similar. Leaders of both Loyalists and Wondering Souls are supportive and decisive. What pulls the two apart is that leaders of Wondering Souls lead by example, where as leaders who have a following of Loyalists generously give their expertise so their employees achieve.
