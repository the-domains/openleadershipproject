By filling out the \#OpenLeadershipProject survey you'll be contributing to an anonymous database of thousands of employee stories about their managers. These are continually analysed by a team that has worked with the Economist Intelligence Unit to uncover what good (and bad leadership) looks like according to industry, gender, seniority and role. All you have to do is:

1. Fill out the survey
2. Once the survey has been filled out you'll be sent a link to download the latest findings for your industry
3. You can share this directly with your boss, send it to HR, or anonymously email it to your manager
4. Or of course, you can use it yourself!
