Crowd-sourcing great leadership skills

A meagre one in five of us worldwide rate our team leaders very highly. So isn't it about time we told our line managers, department heads and CEOs around the planet what we want from our leaders? The trouble is, if we personally set a meeting with the person responsible for promotions (or redundancies) it might get a little awkward, especially if they have a terrible management style. This is why the \#OpenLeadershipProject was created. It's your chance to be part of a global movement that is anonymously uncovering what makes a great leader by surfacing the traits and skills that inspire and motivate a workforce - without any of the toe-gazing and blushing of a one-on-one with the boss or an out-dated 360 review.
