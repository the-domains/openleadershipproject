title: Crowd-sourcing great leadership skills
publisher: {}
description: >-
  A meagre one in five of us worldwide rate our team leaders very highly. So
  isn’t it about time we told our line managers, department heads and CEOs
  around the planet what we want from our leaders? The trouble is, if we
  personally set a meeting with the person responsible for promotions (or
  redundancies) it might get a little awkward, especially if they have a
  terrible management style. This is why the #OpenLeadershipProject was created.
  It’s your chance to be part of a global movement that is anonymously
  uncovering what makes a great leader by surfacing the traits and skills that
  inspire and motivate a workforce - without any of the toe-gazing and blushing
  of a one-on-one with the boss or an out-dated 360 review.
